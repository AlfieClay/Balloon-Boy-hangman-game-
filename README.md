# Balloon-Boy-hangman-game-
**Description:** Balloon boy is a version of hangman which involves balloons popping each time a letter is guessed incorrectly. This makes the game more intuitive than the conventional version, as the number of guesses (balloons) left is pictorially obvious.

**Dependencies**: The only non-default package the game requires is pillow.

**How to run:** Copy the master directory into a local directory. Navigate to this directory in command line/terminal. Run the command ‘[your version of python]python3 balloon_boy.py’.

**Modification ideas:** The ‘dictionary.csv’ file can be modified/added to to change the words that will appear.
